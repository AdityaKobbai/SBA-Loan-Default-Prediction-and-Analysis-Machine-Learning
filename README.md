# SBA Loan Default Analysis, Classification & Feature Engineering, Machine Learning : [SBA Loan Prediction Code](https://github.com/AdityaKobbai/Adithya-Kobbai-s_Portfolio/blob/main/SBA_Loan_Prediction_Code.ipynb)


•Preprocessed the SBA loan dataset using Python, conducting exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and quantified feature importance using Shapley values to identify the top 10 influential features.

•Trained and fine-tuned logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, GBM, LightGBM models, and conducted Principal Component Analysis to achieve an 85% accuracy and F1 score of 0.82 on a holdout dataset.
